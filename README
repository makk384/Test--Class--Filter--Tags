NAME
    Test::Class::Filter::Tags - Selectively run only a subset of Test::Class
    tests that have the specified method tag.

SYNOPSIS
     package MyTests::Wibble;

     # use Attribute::Method::Tags to get Tags definition
     use Attribute::Method::Tags;

     use Base qw( Test::Class );

     # can specify both Test and Tags attributes on test methods
     sub t_foo : Test( 1 ) Tags( quick fast ) {
     }

     sub t_bar : Test( 1 ) Tags( loose ) {
     }

     sub t_baz : Test( 1 ) Tags( fast ) {
     }

     1;


     #
     # in Test::Class driver script, or your Test::Class baseclass
     #
     use Test::Class;
     use Test::Class::Filter::Tags;

     # load the test classes, in whatever manner you normally use
     # ...

     $ENV{ TEST_TAGS } = 'quick,loose';

     Test::Class->runtests;

     # from the test above, only t_foo and t_bar methods would be run, the
     # first because it has the 'quick' tag, and the second becuase it has
     # 'loose' tag.  t_baz doesn't have either tag, so it's not run.

DESCRIPTION
    When used in conjunction with Test::Class tests, that also define
    Attribute::Method::Tags tags, this class allows filtering of the tests
    that will be run. If $ENV{ TEST_TAGS } is set, it will be treated as a
    list of tags, seperated by any combination of whitespace or commas. The
    tests that will be run will only be the subset of tests that have at
    least of these tags specified.

    Note that, as per normal Test::Class behaviour, only normal tests will
    be filtered. Any fixture tests (startup, shutdown, setup and teardown)
    will still be run, where appropriate, whether they have the given
    attributes or not.

TAGS ADDITIVE OVER INHERITANCE
    When inheriting from test classes, the subclasses will adopt any tags
    that the superclass methods have, in addition to any that they specify.
    (ie, tags are addative, when subclass and superclass have the same
    method with different tags, the tags for the subclass method will be
    those from both).

SEE ALSO
    Test::Class
        This class acts as a normal Test::Class filter.

    Attribute::Method::Tags
        Attribute-based tag definitions. This class assumes that you'll be
        implementing tags via this mechanism.
